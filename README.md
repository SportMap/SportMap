# Gdańsk Sports Map Project
## Overview
This group project was undertaken as part of a university course, with the goal of developing an interactive web application designed to promote an active lifestyle within local communities in Gdańsk, the city where we study. It seeks to enhance local sports participation by offering a comprehensive platform for discovering various sports facilities, including unique options such as outdoor gyms. Users can access detailed information on each complex, including categories, opening hours, contact details, and location. Furthermore, the application fosters community involvement by enabling users to submit new complexes and organize events, pending administrator approval. This feature is intended to encourage sports within local communities by making it easier to organize tournaments and group activities.
